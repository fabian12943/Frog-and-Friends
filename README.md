## What's Frog & Friends?
Frog & Friends is a slightly brutal 2D platformer with a commentator who doesn't like you and will comment on each of your actions with a mocking line.
The goal of the game is to collect as many points as possible in the given time by collecting fruits and at the same time avoid to get killed by enemies or traps as often as possible. The player can compete with up to three other players in a local split-screen multiplayer. 

The game was created as a project work for the lecture "Game Programming" at Aalen University in the winter semester of 2021 in the development environment Unity.

## Game Features
### Local splitscreen for up to 4 players
The game allows up to four players to compete simultaneously in split-screen mode. Whoever collects more items within the given time and dies the least wins the game.

### Deadly enemies & treacherous traps
Shooting plants, angry rhinos and poisonous mushrooms. On top of that, rotating saw blades, falling platforms and rocks that crush you. Without the necessary skill, many deaths and nasty comments await.

### A mocking commentator you cannot please
A commentator who doesn't like you or the way you play and lets you know it in every sentence, no matter if you just died, scored a point or even won. In total, the game offers over 70 phrases that were created with the help of an AI speech synthesis website.

### Bloody violence
No matter if player character or enemy: Everything that dies shatters into many, bloody pieces. 

### A huge first level
The game already offers a huge first level, which provides challenges at every turn.

### Support for keyboard and gamepads
Whether you prefer a keyboard, PS4, PS5, or XBox gamepad, the game can be played with practically
any current gamepad. Navigating the menus is equally possible with a gamepad.
